#Description- In this code it create a turtle moving the direction that is moving left,forward,right and backward creating little braches. 
def draw(t, length, n): #The function
    if n == 0:
        return
    angle = 50
    fd(t, length*n) # Moving foward (Foward distance)
    lt(t, angle) # Left tuen (Moving left)
    draw(t, length, n-1) #calling the function 
    rt(t, 2*angle) #Moving right (right turn by 100 degree)
    draw(t, length, n-1) #calling the function again
    lt(t, angle) #Left turn returnning to the original design/direction
    bk(t, length*n)#Moving backward
